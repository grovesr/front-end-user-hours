Set in  root WP php.ini: max_execution_time 115 (this is less than the bluehost nginx script execution timelimit of 120 seconds
 but more than the default 30 seconds. This allows us the ability to add 100 users at a time from a spreadsheat

On ubuntu16.04 had to do: sudo apt-get install php7.0-zip

To add users without adding duplicate users, I had to alter the front-end-only-users plugin Update_Admin_Databases.php function:
  I just ended up folding the user add function into the front-end-user-hours plugin so I could fix it without worrying about the FEUP authors

These are what can be set in the user add spreadsheet:
